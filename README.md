## Random Password Generator

# Description

Many consumers set simple passwords to guard sensitive information that hackers can easily crack. To combat the issue, this program will generate a random password using a user-selected combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters between 8 and 128 characters, yielding a very strong password that is harder to crack. Building this project reenforces basic Javascript concepts of variable assignment, conditional statements, for loops, and random string character generation.

Click the button, "Generate Password," then type an integer signifying a password length between (and including) 8 and 128 characters. Next, select at least one character type. Writing a password length less than 8 characters or greater than 128 characters, or not selecting any character types, will cause the program to run through the prompts again, until the password criteria are met.
